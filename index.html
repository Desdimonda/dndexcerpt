    <h1><b>Lesson</b></h1>
    <h3><p>by Shona Kelly</p></h3>
  </div>

	<hr>

<p>It had to be a joke that she’d run into the person who knew her when she was Ashes, and the Vanquish from whom she’d stolen life and identity. Endless miles away from home, there was no escape from the bonds that tie. They persisted and resisted, a constant slithering noose around her neck that never relinquished. 

<p>Vanquish - the name still sticky on her tongue - looked from Ozris, then to the focus on her wrist. Bound. The worn gold set into her skin like it belonged. Because it did. She traced the edging of the purple stone, trying to feel what had once been beneath. Because now all she felt was a vacant void. Cold. Callous. 

<p>It blinked.

<p>She touched the centre of the stone with a finger, a ragged nail tapping the pristine surface. 

<p>‘What?’ 

<p>Cold. Callous.

<p>“This must be it,” rumbled Ozris as they hovered by the doorway, eyes trailing over the scene. Sword in skeleton’s hand. Skeleton upon a throne. Darkness, everywhere.

<p>“Must it?” drawled Vanquish, her heavy Damarian accent rolling off the walls.

<p>Ozris staggered forward, passing two elaborate pillars, indented with time. His broad, winged back shifted with each step. Vanquish was sure she saw a tremor in each step that wasn’t his impending death. Anticipation. Neither truly knew what it did, only that it was whispered to hold a power of immortality. And that whisper tasted too sweet to Vanquish to not give chase. 

<p>Even if she let him hold it first - she’d get it. He’d be a test, an observation, a header in her notes with several pages to follow, before she safely took it for herself. 

<p>Vanquish followed his laboured steps, and passed one of the pillars. It changed. The veil of black that pressed around them cracked as atop one of the pillars, a brilliant purple light  shone.

<p>She looked from the light to Ozris, watching him pass another pillar. Unlit. 

<p><em>Me?</em>

<p>Hurried, excited, she ran forward past the other set of pillars, looking up just in time to see them alight.

<p><em>Or...You?</em>

<p>Vanquish was sure she felt a low, familiar laugh creep behind her mind. The room was bathed in a delicate, violet glow. Too delicate for what they saw.

<p>Beneath Vanquish’s feet, etched into the weathered stone was a giant eye, crowned with an array of symbols and carvings that Vanquish knew. 

<p>“Ozris. Oz-” Another set of hurried steps, another set of purple lights. “Wait. This place. This sword-” For a dying man, he was quick. And she wasn’t quick enough. 

<p>The skeleton stood, brandishing their prize and sent Ozris flying into the nearest lit pillar. Vanquish stared at her daggers, wondering what they’d do as she thought little and just charged. But in the end she did nothing.

<p>Her back met the opposite pillar, so sure the trickle of purple light above fell, scattering to her feet and the engraved eye on the floor. Or was that her blood? The runes seemed to shift as she breathed. 

<p>Wasn’t the burning off of her horns from her fellow warlocks enough punishment for turning her back on Him? But He knew her well - so well. How could she have said no to Y’chak’s temptation when it strolled into her life in the shape of Drow and Envoy, tying his threads around her, one by one, to pull her aside, within, offering her all she’d ever wanted in a package of need and want and trust, when-

<p>-all You had ever done was bind and take.

<p>Vanquish rolled to the side just in time, hearing the sword scrape metal to stone. Her knees and palms hit the eye, catching the ends of her purple braid. 

<p><center><em>You should beg.</em></center>

<p>The words, so clear, so loud, they brushed against her ear, from lips familiar and warm that she’d left behind. But they licked against her mind, from somewhere too far out there. 

<p>The skeleton approached. Slow, laboured steps that seemed to hover outside the ring that Vanquish knelt within, her palms still pressed to stone, daggers long discarded. The sword they both longed for dragged against the floor, composing their demise.

<p><center><em>You begged for <b>them.</b></em></center>

<p>Ambiguity saturated the words, but Vanquish knew exactly what the voice meant. The one she’d ran away from. Nezzar. An unassuming name to some, but the authority he carried, was not. The Old One, Y’Chak, stepped as a mortal on this plane through him. Just because they could. 

<p>Vanquish’s patron, ever since a teen, had been a constant voice, awake, asleep, in her mind, like a nail scratching, seeking, wanting.

<p>But Nezzar - Y’Chak - had given her peace. And then promised power. But in the end, all he really gave her was pain.

<p>Bony feet obscured the runes, close enough to touch. 

<p><center><em>Their name dripped from your lips.</em></center>

<p>Vanquish was sure the eye beneath her moved.

<p><center><em>My name should - not theirs.  </em></center>

<p>Her fingernails almost seared the stone.

<p><center><em>Say my name. And I’ll let you live.</em></center>

<p>The sword caught the purple light, which caught her eye, the deathly edge a breath from her face.

<p>“Fuck you, Caiphon!”

<p>In a song only Vanquish could hear, the runes breathed to life around the eye, and beneath a closed lid that had shifted beneath her just as the sword above did, the ground erupted in a cataclysm of fury, of power and magic so raw that Vanquish was sure she would burn again. 

<p>And brushing by her were limbs, pushing through several portals hanging in the air around her, black, ringed in purple, speckled with stars and whorls of light. Tentacles, crackling with a power she’d known from that day she inherited her sister’s dark magic and His voice; a power she’d turned away to find peace; a power, now it touched her again - within, without - she missed.

<p>The tentacles uplifted her from the ground, embracing her tired body and settling her as if on a throne of crackling violet that breathed. They waited for her command.

<p>The skeleton paused as it stared at Vanquish, seemingly unsure which limb to sever first. But that choice was soon quelled as Vanquish reached out her hands in guidance - unnecessary - as her mind was a pathway for these other born creatures. 

<p>From stillness to strike, their movement was a flash, tendrils wrapping around each of the skeletons' limbs as painted by her mind. Vanquish squeezed her hands tightly, watching as the tentacles echoed the motion, as the crack of bones met her ears. The sword fell from its broken hand. 

<p>Then its head fell from its broken body, shreds and shatters of bones spraying across the floor, littering the eye in a fall of tears. The tentacles withdrew back to Vanquish, setting her back onto the ground in an oddly gentle way for such ferocity, seconds before. She turned around to gaze upon her newly granted power, only to then realise it was gone. But glancing down at her focus, it blinked again, a shred of the power remaining behind that had abandoned her.

	<center><p><em>That you abandoned, Ashes.</em></center>

<p>Her name slithered across her mind, hissed and broken into a laugh before she tried to push herself up. But the sword was there. Right there. A promise of immortality woven into its steel, and all she had to do was-

<p>Move.

	<p><center><em>This one, you watch.</em></center>

<p>And she did, frozen in place on the bone shattered eye as Ozris staggered over to the sword, arm outstretched, desperate and longing.

<p>And all Vanquish could do was watch.
